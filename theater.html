            <h2>THE CHERRY ORCHARD Act 4 by Anton Chekov</h2>
            <p>LOPAKHIN. Eight roubles a bottle. [Pause] It's devilish cold here.</p>

            <p>YASHA. There are no fires to-day, we're going away. [Laughs]</p>
                
            <p>LOPAKHIN. What's the matter with you?</p>
                
            <p>YASHA. I'm just pleased.</p>
                
            <p>LOPAKHIN. It's October outside, but it's as sunny and as quiet as if
                it were summer. Good for building. [Looking at his watch and speaking
                through the door] Ladies and gentlemen, please remember that it's only
                forty-seven minutes till the train goes! You must go off to the station
                in twenty minutes. Hurry up.</p>
                
            <p>[TROFIMOV, in an overcoat, comes in from the grounds.]</p>
                
            <p>TROFIMOV. I think it's time we went. The carriages are waiting. Where
                the devil are my goloshes? They're lost. [Through the door] Anya, I
                can't find my goloshes! I can't!</p>
