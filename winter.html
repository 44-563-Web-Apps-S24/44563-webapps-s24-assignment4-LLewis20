            <p class="speech">I've got to go to Kharkov. I'm going in the same train as you.
                I'm going to spend the whole winter in Kharkov. I've been hanging about
                with you people, going rusty without work. I can't live without working.
                I must have something to do with my hands; they hang about as if they
                weren't mine at all.</p>

                labours.</p>
